SySE is a syntactic sentence extracter based on pystatparser, which in turn is based on nltk. nltk is not available on Windows systems, therefore, this program is not expected to work on them.
It can be found on github here: https://github.com/NathanWycoff/SySE
You can reach its author, Nathan Wycoff, at nathanbrwycoff@gmail.com
***Installation:
You must first download pystatparser:
pip install --upgrade https://github.com/emilmont/pyStatParser/tarball/master

Then you can install SySE:
pip install --upgrade https://github.com/NathanWycoff/SySE/tarball/master

Useage:
from syse import SySE
sy = SySE()

#Train on a dataset
sy.train(trainingSentences, importanceLabels)

#Evaluate a single sentence without context
sy.classify("This is an important sentence")

#Summarize an article (str or unicode) stored in myArticle
sy.summarize(myArticle)

#If you would like to use the default parameters, you should download the files titled "default", "defaultI.csv", and "defaultR.csv".
#Then, you may place them in any directory you would like and point to the "default" file using the "loadParameters" method.
#For example, if you have placed the files in /home/user/myFolder, you would call:
sy.loadParameters('/home/user/myFolder/default')
