SySE is a syntactic sentence extracter based on pystatparser, which in turn is based on nltk. nltk is not available on Windows systems, therefore, this program is not expected to work on them.
It can be found on github here: https://github.com/NathanWycoff/SySE
You can reach its author, Nathan Wycoff, at nathanbrwycoff@gmail.com
